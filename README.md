## Installation Instructions

To get the development environment running, one will need clone the MarkMeDown repository to their workstation. If not done already, ensure node.js is installed on their workstation. At the root of the directory, create a .gitignore file and add node*modules and .DS_Store to it. At the command-line, write \*\*npm \_init*** to create a package.json file. Again at the command-line write **npm _install inquirer_** to install the inquirer package. Finally, to get the app running run this last command: **node _index.js_\*\*
